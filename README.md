### Easy setup

Step 1: Issue `tetrationcli setup` and folow the instructions and place the correct information presented
```
$ tetrationcli setup
Tetration Analytics cluster (eg: https://great.example.com/): https://great.example.com/
Tetration API Key: ASDASDASADS
Tetration API Secret: ASDASDASDASDFFF
```

Step 2: Test if you can successfully query the cluster from the command line
```
$ tetrationcli agents list
```

### Manually setup the application

The file `api_credentials.json` downloaded from the cluster is expected to be placed in 
folder `~/.config/tetrationcli/` then to define the cluster name you need to create the 
config file `tetrationcli.conf` in `%HOME_USER_FOLDER%/.config/tetrationcli/`

```

0 drwxr-xr-x   4 user  staff  128 Nov 11 16:16 .
0 drwx------  13 user  staff  416 Nov 11 16:10 ..

8 -rw-r--r--   1 user  staff  121 Nov 11 16:16 tetrationcli.conf
```
and the file `tetrationcli.conf` requires the information:
```
[tetrationcli]
api_endpoint = https://mygreatapp.example.com
api_credentials = ~/.config/tetrationcli/api_credentials.json
```
